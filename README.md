# ![Chromatic PoE](./apps/backend/icons/Square44x44Logo.png) Chromatic PoE 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Chromatic PoE is currently in a pre-release state. It is usable but not feature complete.

Chromatic PoE is a tool to generate [item filters](https://www.pathofexile.com/item-filter/about) for Path of Exile. It is free and open source for the peace of mind of anyone that uses it.

See [Releases](https://github.com/jchantrell/chromatic-poe/releases) for downloads of the desktop application. Alternatively you can use the [web application](https://jchantrell.github.io/chromatic-poe/) for the same functionality, just without the desktop native features like automatic reloading in-game.

## Assets
I do not own any of the assets utilised in this project. In most cases they are taken from Path of Exile's game files or website dynamically and belong to Grinding Gear Games as a result. If you are the owner of an asset used in this application and wish for it to be removed, please reach out to me via my Github email.
